# Project MNIST

This branch contains the MNIST project for the AI Security Portfolio.

## Goals
- Train a baseline CNN on MNIST
- Implement FGSM & PGD adversarial attacks
- Test adversarial training defenses
- Show demo results & analysis

## Structure
- `/notebooks` → Jupyter notebooks for training & attacks
- `/data` → MNIST dataset (downloaded automatically)
- `/src` → Python scripts (model, attack, training helpers)
- `/results` → Saved adversarial samples & evaluation metrics
